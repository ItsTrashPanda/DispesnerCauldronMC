# DispesnerCauldronMC
Minecraft Datapack that lets you use a dispenser on a cauldron using buckets or bottles.

# Note From Maker
As far as I can tell this has no bugs, I do not foresee myself updating this unless bugs arise.

# Special thanks to SirRandomOne
He is responsible for adding powdered snow and bottle functionality along with ironing out some bugs from the latest version of 1.17. Check him out here: https://github.com/SirRandomOne

# Pls don't steal this and call it your own
I really could care less about this. I put very little effort into it, so little that I didn't put any formal copyright on this so... just don't steal it.
