# Dispesner_Cauldron_V2_MC1.17
Minecraft Datapack that lets you use a dispenser on a cauldron using buckets.

# Note From Maker
As far as I can tell this has no bugs, I do not foresee myself updating this unless bugs arise. In the unlikely case that this becomes popular and people want me to add water bottle functionality or powdered snow, I might do that but otherwise, I consider this finished. This very well may not work in the future as I have developed it while 1.17 is still in its snapshots phase so be aware of that.

# Pls don't steal this and call it your own
I really could care less about this. I put very little effort into it, so little that I didn't put any formal copyright on this so... just don't steal it.
